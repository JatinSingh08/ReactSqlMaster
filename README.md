## ‚è± Page Load Time

Page Load time of this website in desktop is in the range of 0.4 s to 0.6s.

I calculated the performance and load time of this website using these two tools Lighthouse Chrome DevTools and BrowserStack SpeedLab.

- **First Contentful Paint** marks the time at which the first text or image is painted
- **Time to interactive** is the amount of time it takes for the page to become fully interactive.
- **Speed Index** shows how quickly the contents of a page are visibly populated.
- **Total Blocking Time** is the sum of all time periods between FCP and Time to Interactive, when task length exceeded 50ms, expressed in milliseconds.
- **Largest Contentful Paint** marks the time at which the largest text or image is painted.
- **Cumulative Layout Shift** measures the movement of visible elements within the viewport.


## ü™ú Steps I took to optimize the page load time

- Used code-splitting with `React.Lazy()` and `Suspense` to lazy load the components and split javaScript into multiple chunks using Dynamic runtime Imports for faster page load.
- Used `React.Memo()` to optimize the render performance of functional components.
- Used Lighthouse DevTools Extension to find the performance issues and fix them using their actionable suggestion.
- Used vercel to deploy this website to leverage its Vercel Edge Network compression that results in the better performance.
